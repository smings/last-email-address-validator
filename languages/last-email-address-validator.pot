        "com, .net, .org, .mil, .edu ...) indeed mostly country domains. "
        "Today there are more than 1,500 top-level domains, which gets more "

        "or less describing geography, organizational types and more and more "

        "private mansions, public buildings, condo buildings, appartment "
        "buildings etc.<br/><br/>The <strong>domain</strong> part is the "
        "equivalent of a specific building or house of the general type "
        "defined by the top-level domain. The house or building has one or "
